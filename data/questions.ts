For them, species are often defined based on morphological, biochemical, or genetic similarities.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M12', prompt: 'Explain the importance of museums in taxonomic studies.', canonicalAnswer: 'Museums are crucial for taxonomy as they store and preserve specimens (both plants and animals) that serve as a reference for identification and classification. These preserved specimens act as factual evidence for future studies.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M13', prompt: 'Why is binomial nomenclature considered more useful than using common names?', canonicalAnswer: 'Binomial nomenclature provides a unique, universal scientific name for each organism, avoiding the confusion of common names which vary by language, region, and can sometimes be misleading.

            { id: 'B-LW-M17', prompt: 'Why are common names for species not ideal for scientific use?', canonicalAnswer: 'Common names are not ideal because they vary from place to place and language to language. A single species may have multiple common names, and one common name may refer to multiple species, leading to confusion.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M18', prompt: 'Describe the process of preparing a plant specimen for a herbarium.', canonicalAnswer: 'The process involves collecting the specimen, pressing it flat in a plant press to remove moisture, drying it carefully to prevent decay, and then mounting it on a herbarium sheet with an appropriate label containing collection data.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M19', prompt: '"Growth and reproduction are mutually exclusive events in higher organisms." Explain this statement.', canonicalAnswer: 'In higher plants and animals, growth refers to an increase in body size, while reproduction is the process of producing new individuals. These are two distinct processes. In unicellular organisms, however, growth (cell division) is itself a form of reproduction.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M20', prompt: 'Why are taxonomical aids important? Name any four.', canonicalAnswer: 'Taxonomical aids are important for the identification, classification, and study of organisms. They serve as a storehouse of information and specimens.

            { id: 'B-LW-M22', prompt: 'How is a taxonomic key constructed and used for identification?', canonicalAnswer: 'A taxonomic key is constructed using contrasting characteristics, usually in pairs called couplets. To use it, one chooses the statement that best fits the organism, which leads to another couplet, progressively narrowing down the options until the organism is identified.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M23', prompt: 'Explain the concept of biodiversity.', canonicalAnswer: 'Biodiversity, or biological diversity, refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. It includes diversity within species (genetic diversity), between species (species diversity), and of ecosystems (ecosystem diversity).', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M24', prompt: 'Differentiate between a genus and a species, providing an example.', canonicalAnswer: 'A species is a group of individual organisms with fundamental similarities that can interbreed. A genus is a group of related species. For example, Panthera is a genus which includes the species leo (lion) and tigris (tiger).', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M25', prompt: 'Discuss the role of consciousness as a defining property of life.', canonicalAnswer: 'Consciousness, the ability to sense the environment and respond to stimuli, is a defining property of all living organisms. While plants respond to light and animals to touch, only humans possess self-consciousness, or awareness of oneself.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M26', prompt: 'Explain the difference between analogy and homology in the context of classification.', canonicalAnswer: 'Homology is the similarity between organisms due to shared ancestry (e.g., the forelimbs of humans and bats). Analogy is the similarity in function and superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins (e.g., wings of a bird and an insect).', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M27', prompt: '"All living phenomena are due to underlying interactions." Justify this statement.', canonicalAnswer: 'This refers to emergent properties. For example, the properties of a tissue are not present in its constituent cells but arise from the interaction among these cells. This principle applies to all levels of biological organization.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M28', prompt: 'What are the main advantages of using scientific names over common names?', canonicalAnswer: 'Scientific names are universal, unique, and unambiguous. They prevent confusion that arises from common names, which can vary by language and region and may be misleading.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M29', prompt: 'Describe the key features of the kingdom Protista.', canonicalAnswer: 'Kingdom Protista includes all single-celled eukaryotes. They have a well-defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. They can be autotrophic (like algae) or heterotrophic (like protozoans).', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M30', prompt: 'Explain the role of botanical gardens in ex-situ conservation.', canonicalAnswer: 'Ex-situ conservation means conserving species outside their natural habitats. Botanical gardens contribute by cultivating and preserving rare and endangered plant species, maintaining seed banks, and educating the public.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M31', prompt: 'Why is it said that growth and reproduction are mutually inclusive events in unicellular organisms?', canonicalAnswer: 'In unicellular organisms like bacteria and amoeba, growth (increase in size of the cell) is followed by cell division, which is their mode of reproduction. Thus, the two processes are essentially the same.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M32', prompt: 'What is the significance of the binomial nomenclature system beyond just naming?', canonicalAnswer: 'Besides providing a unique name, the binomial system also indicates the taxonomic rank of the organism. The first part (genus) shows its relationship to other closely related species within the same genus.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M33', prompt: 'How does the concept of species differ in prokaryotes compared to eukaryotes?', canonicalAnswer: 'The biological species concept (interbreeding) works for many eukaryotes but not for asexually reproducing prokaryotes. For prokaryotes, a species is often defined as a collection of strains sharing a high degree of similarity in many independent characteristics.', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M34', prompt: 'Why are viruses considered to be on the borderline between living and non-living?', canonicalAnswer: 'Viruses are inert and crystalline outside a host cell (non-living characteristic). However, once inside a host cell, they take over the host\'s machinery to replicate themselves (living characteristic).', maxMarks: 4 },
            { id: 'B-LW-M35', prompt: '"The properties of tissues are not present in the constituent cells." Explain this statement.', canonicalAnswer: 'This is the principle of emergent properties. A single cell cannot perform the function of a tissue. For example, the contractility of muscle tissue arises from the coordinated action of many muscle cells, a property not found in an isolated cell.', maxMarks: 4 },
          ],
          [Difficulty.Difficult]: [
            { id: 'B-LW-D1', prompt: 'Describe the universal rules of nomenclature as proposed by Linnaeus.', canonicalAnswer: 'The rules are: 1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics. 2. The first word represents the genus while the second word denotes the specific epithet. 3. When handwritten, both words are separately underlined. 4. The first word (genus) starts with a capital letter while the specific epithet starts with a small letter.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D2', prompt: 'Why are classification systems dynamic and subject to change?', canonicalAnswer: 'Classification systems change over time due to advancements in our understanding of evolutionary relationships (phylogeny), new evidence from fields like molecular genetics (DNA sequencing), and the discovery of new species. Early systems were based on morphology, while modern systems are more comprehensive and aim to reflect evolutionary history.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D3', prompt: '"Reproduction cannot be an all-inclusive defining characteristic of living organisms." Justify this statement with examples.', canonicalAnswer: 'This is true because there are living organisms that do not reproduce. For example, sterile worker bees, mules, and infertile human couples are all living but cannot produce offspring. Therefore, while reproduction is a key characteristic of life, it is not a universally defining feature.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D4', prompt: 'What is a monograph versus a flora? How do these taxonomic aids differ in their scope?', canonicalAnswer: 'A monograph provides a comprehensive account of a single taxon (like a genus or family) from all over the world. A flora, on the other hand, contains the account of all plant species found in a particular geographical area, including keys for their identification.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D5', prompt: 'Discuss the challenges in defining the term \'species\'. Mention the biological species concept.', canonicalAnswer: 'Defining a species is complex. The biological species concept defines it as a group of individuals that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. However, this concept fails for asexually reproducing organisms (like bacteria), extinct fossils, and cases of hybridization in plants. This makes a universal definition difficult.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D6', prompt: 'Compare and contrast the two-kingdom and five-kingdom classification systems. Who proposed them?', canonicalAnswer: 'The two-kingdom system, proposed by Linnaeus, classified all organisms into Plantae and Animalia. It was simple but had major drawbacks, like grouping prokaryotes with eukaryotes. The five-kingdom system by R.H. Whittaker (1969) classified organisms into Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia based on cell structure, mode of nutrition, and body organization, providing a more scientific basis.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D7', prompt: 'Explain the concepts of metabolism, anabolism, and catabolism. Why is metabolism a defining feature of life?', canonicalAnswer: 'Metabolism is the sum total of all chemical reactions occurring in a living organism. It has two parts: anabolism (constructive reactions, e.g., photosynthesis) and catabolism (destructive reactions, e.g., respiration). Metabolism is a defining feature because no non-living object exhibits it, and it is essential for an organism\'s survival, growth, and reproduction.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D8', prompt: 'What is meant by the term "phylogeny"? Why is it important in modern classification?', canonicalAnswer: 'Phylogeny is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms. It is crucial in modern classification (systematics) because the goal is to have a classification system that reflects the evolutionary pathways and connections between different species, creating a "natural" system of classification.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D9', prompt: 'Explain the process of creating a herbarium sheet. What information does it typically carry?', canonicalAnswer: 'A herbarium sheet is created by collecting, pressing, drying, and mounting a plant specimen on a sheet of paper. It is labeled with essential information, including the date and place of collection, the English, local, and botanical names of the plant, the family of the plant, and the collector\'s name. This data is crucial for future scientific reference.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D10', prompt: 'Discuss how self-consciousness distinguishes humans from other living organisms.', canonicalAnswer: 'While all living organisms possess consciousness (awareness of their surroundings), humans are believed to be the only organisms that have self-consciousness. This means humans are aware of themselves, their thoughts, feelings, and existence. This higher level of awareness allows for complex thought, introspection, and culture, setting humans apart.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D11', prompt: 'Discuss the role of chemosystematics and cytosystematics in modern taxonomy.', canonicalAnswer: 'Chemosystematics uses chemical constituents of the organism (like proteins, amino acids, DNA sequences) to resolve taxonomic confusions. Cytosystematics uses cytological information like chromosome number, structure, and behavior to establish relationships between taxa. Both provide crucial evidence beyond just morphology.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D12', prompt: '"The taxonomic hierarchy is a reflection of evolutionary relationships." Critically evaluate this statement.', canonicalAnswer: 'Ideally, the taxonomic hierarchy should reflect phylogeny, where organisms in the same taxon share a more recent common ancestor than with organisms in other taxa. While modern systematics aims for this, historical classifications were often based on superficial similarities (analogy) rather than shared ancestry (homology), leading to some non-phylogenetic groupings that are still being revised.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D13', prompt: 'How do taxonomic keys help in the identification of organisms? Explain the concept of a couplet and a lead in a dichotomous key.', canonicalAnswer: 'Taxonomic keys are analytical tools for identification. A dichotomous key consists of a series of choices. Each pair of contrasting statements is called a couplet. Each statement within a couplet is called a lead. By selecting the lead that best describes the organism at each step, one can progressively narrow down the possibilities and arrive at the correct identification.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D14', prompt: 'Compare the merits and demerits of the three-domain system of classification proposed by Carl Woese.', canonicalAnswer: 'The three-domain system (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya) is a merit because it highlights the fundamental difference between prokaryotic Archaea and Bacteria based on rRNA sequences. This reflects evolutionary history better than the five-kingdom system. A demerit is that it complicates the traditional hierarchy and is less intuitive, particularly regarding the status of the kingdom Monera.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D15', prompt: 'Explain the concept of the \'species problem\' in biology, highlighting the limitations of the biological species concept.', canonicalAnswer: 'The \'species problem\' refers to the difficulty in finding a universally applicable definition for a species. The Biological Species Concept (based on interbreeding) is widely used but fails for asexually reproducing organisms, fossils, and distinct species that can hybridize. This necessitates other concepts like the morphological or phylogenetic species concepts, but none are without limitations.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D16', prompt: '"Classification systems are not static but dynamic." Justify this statement with reference to the history of biological classification.', canonicalAnswer: 'This statement is true because classification systems evolve as our knowledge grows. Early systems like Aristotle\'s were simple. Linnaeus introduced a more structured two-kingdom system based on morphology. The invention of the microscope led to the discovery of microorganisms, prompting systems like Haeckel\'s three-kingdom and Whittaker\'s five-kingdom systems. Most recently, genetic evidence led to Woese\'s three-domain system. Each change reflects a deeper, more accurate understanding of life\'s diversity and evolutionary history.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D17', prompt: 'Critically evaluate the merits and demerits of the five-kingdom classification system proposed by Whittaker.', canonicalAnswer: 'Merits: It is more scientific than the two-kingdom system as it separates prokaryotes (Monera), places fungi in a separate kingdom due to their unique mode of nutrition, and groups unicellular eukaryotes into Protista. Demerits: The kingdom Protista is very diverse and includes organisms that are more closely related to other kingdoms (e.g., algae to plants). Viruses are not placed in any kingdom. It doesn\'t fully reflect the evolutionary relationships among organisms.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'B-LW-D18', prompt: 'What is the species problem?

Now, use the Gibbs equation: ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = -12.98 kJ - (298 K)(-44.1 x 10⁻³ kJ/K) = -12.98 + 13.14 ≈ +0.16 kJ. Since ΔG° is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions.', maxMarks: 6 },
            { id: 'C-T-D2', prompt: 'Explain the third law of thermodynamics and its significance.', canonicalAnswer: 'The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero (0 Kelvin) is exactly zero. Its significance is that it provides an absolute reference point for determining the entropy of a substance at any other temperature. This allows for the calculation of absolute entropy values for chemical substances.', maxMarks: 6 },
